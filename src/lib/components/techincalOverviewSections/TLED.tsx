            Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamics
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
            TLED is a numerical method used to simulate the behavior and deformation of materials under 
            dynamic conditions. It is particularly applicable in scenarios 
            where large deformations, high velocities, and transient effects are involved. TLED is commonly 
            employed in various fields, including structural mechanics, solid mechanics, and computational physics.
            The TLED method operates within the framework of the FEM and is designed to 
            accurately capture the dynamic response of materials. It solves the equations of motion based on 
            the total Lagrangian formulation, where the deformation gradient is measured with respect to the 
            initial configuration of the material. This approach ensures accurate and consistent handling of 
            large deformations, enabling the simulation of complex material behaviors.
        </Typography> 

        <Typography>
            The explicit dynamics aspect of TLED implies that the time integration is performed explicitly, meaning 
            that the equations of motion are directly solved in a step-by-step manner. This explicit time integration 
            scheme allows for efficient and stable simulations, particularly for problems with short duration events 
            or highly transient phenomena.
            One of the key advantages of TLED is its ability to accurately capture material failure and fragmentation,
            as well as the propagation of waves and shocks through the material. This makes it suitable for studying 
            impact and collision scenarios, as well as dynamic events involving highly nonlinear material behavior.

            The Total Lagrangian (TL) formulation was specifically chosen for BirthView owing to the fact that a
            substantial number of values can be pre-computed and reused throughout the simulation. Since BirthView 
            is a real-time simulation, reducing the number computations is paramount to ensure that the program 
            can run smoothly.
            To implement TLED, the material properties and behavior are typically described using constitutive 
            models that capture the mechanical response of the material under various loading conditions.
            These models are integrated into the simulation framework to accurately represent the material's deformation,
            stress, and strain behavior.
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
            The TLED explicit FE formulation is utilized in conjunction with a projection-based contact method 
            to compute the contact forces that induce deformation in the soft tissues, resulting in the rotation of 
            the fetal head. The external body forces acting on the system consist of the intra-uterine expulsion 
            force and the maternal bearing down forces. The soft tissues, including the pelvic floor muscles, 
            ligaments, and uterine cervix, are represented using tetrahedral elements and Neo-Hookean hyperelastic 
            material properties. Additionally, the model incorporates static components, such as the maternal pelvis,
            and dynamic components, such as the fetus represented as a rigid body.
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
            The fetus is composed of the fetal head and the fetal body, connected by the fetal neck. The fetal neck 
            is modeled using linear and torsional springs to resist translations and rotations, respectively. Bending motions,
            including flexion, extension, and lateral flexion, are constrained by the contact between the fetal head and the 
            fetal body. Rotations in the transverse plane are restricted by the torsional spring.

            The approximation of this integral can be achieved using three-dimensional Gaussian quadrature integration.
            By selecting quadrature points in each dimension, a triple summation is obtained by multiplying the three-dimensional 
            weights with the function value at each quadrature point. To simplify this triple summation, it is often condensed into 
            a single summation. This is done by multiplying the weights in each dimension together, resulting in a single weight
            for each of the <Tex>{'n_q'}</Tex> quadrature points.
